.SYNOPSIS
    Shares private files from .shared\ with git worktrees: -link, -copy or -unlink.

.DESCRIPTION
    Author:  Emeterio M. Sumagang Jr.
    Company: yngsoftware (www.yngsoftware.com)

    Works with any project laid out as a bare repository with one folder per
    worktree (the "Bare Repository + Git Worktrees" pattern):

        <project-root>\
        |-- .bare\          shared git database
        |-- .shared\        private, untracked files (.env, secrets\, ...)
        |-- main\           worktree
        |-- <other>\        more worktrees (epic, task, agent, ...)
        `-- yngshared.ps1   <- this script (must sit at the project root)

    REQUIREMENTS
    - Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+, on Windows (uses cmd's mklink
      and fsutil).
    - Git on PATH (only needed for -All).
    - A project root containing .bare\ and .shared\ as shown above.
    - For -link: Developer Mode or an elevated shell (see SYMBOLIC LINKS).

    INSTALL
    Copy this file into the project root, beside .bare\ and .shared\. The
    script treats its own folder as the project root, so it cannot be run from
    anywhere else. Nothing else needs installing.

    HOW TO RUN
    From the project root (or via its full path), pick one action and the
    worktree(s) to apply it to, for example:  .\yngshared.ps1 -link main
    See the EXAMPLES section below. Preview any run first with -WhatIf.

    Every existing file inside .shared\, including subfolders, is an "item".
    Matching destination folders are created as real folders; only files are
    linked. Empty folders are ignored. Choose exactly
    one action, and the worktree(s) to apply it to:

        -link     Put a symbolic link to each item in the worktree. The worktree
                  follows .shared\: edit the file through any worktree and every
                  linked worktree sees the change.
        -copy     Put a real, independent copy of each item in the worktree.
                  Same result as -link followed by -unlink. Use it when a
                  worktree needs its own .env values.
        -unlink   Turn each link into a real copy of the item it pointed to.
                  Only links into .shared\ are touched; real files are never
                  changed.

    Nothing inside .shared\ is ever changed, moved or deleted.

    WHAT HAPPENS TO WHAT IS ALREADY IN THE WORKTREE

    "Link" below means a symlink, junction or hard link that points into
    .shared\ (older versions of this script sometimes left hard links; they are
    recognised and handled like symlinks).

      At the path                  -link              -copy               -unlink
      ---------------------------  -----------------  ------------------  ------------------
      nothing there                symlink            real copy           skip (not present)
      link into .shared\           keep (already      convert to a real   convert to a real
                                   linked); a hard    copy                copy
                                   link or junction
                                   becomes a symlink
      real file                    keep               keep                keep
        ...with -Force             back up, symlink   back up, copy       keep (no effect)
      real folder (where a         warn and skip      warn and skip       keep
      file should go)
        ...with -Force             warn and skip      warn and skip       keep (no effect)
      link somewhere else, or      warn and skip      warn and skip       warn and skip
      broken link
        ...with -Force             replace with a     replace with a      warn and skip
                                   symlink            copy

    Without -Force nothing real is ever overwritten, so a worktree's own .env
    survives and re-running is always safe. A worktree opts out of sharing simply
    by having its own real file at that path.

    -Force only ever replaces files. A real folder sitting where a file should go
    is never backed up, moved or replaced, with or without -Force; it is reported
    as a warning and you sort it out by hand.

    LINKED FOLDERS
    If a folder between the worktree and the file is itself a link (older
    versions of this script linked whole folders, e.g. secrets -> ..\.shared\secrets),
    anything done beneath it would land in the link's target, possibly inside
    .shared\. So every action, -Force included, warns and skips files beneath a
    linked folder. Remove that folder link yourself with 'cmd /c rmdir dev\secrets'
    (removes only the link, never what it points to; avoid Remove-Item -Recurse
    on it), then run the script again to create per-file links.

    -FORCE AND BACKUPS
    With -Force, a real file that differs from the shared item is
    first renamed inside the same worktree to
        <name>.yngshared-bak-<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>
    for example .env.yngshared-bak-20260919-153000. The first time a backup is
    made, the pattern *.yngshared-bak-* is added to .bare\info\exclude, a local
    Git file that is never committed and applies to every worktree, so backups
    (which may contain secrets) can never show up in 'git status' or be
    committed by accident. No backup is made when the existing file is
    byte-identical to the shared one, or when the path is only a stray link.
    The script never deletes backups; delete them yourself when you are happy.

    SYMBOLIC LINKS
    Each link points at one file, never at a folder, and is relative to its own
    location: ..\.shared\.env for dev\.env, ..\..\.shared\config\app.ini for
    dev\config\app.ini. They keep working if the project folder is moved or
    renamed. Creating symlinks on Windows needs
    Developer Mode (Settings > System > Advanced > For developers) or an
    elevated (administrator) shell. If they are not permitted, -link stops with
    an error and changes nothing. -copy and -unlink do not need symlinks.

    MISTAKES SHOW THE HELP
    No action, more than one action, an unknown switch, or no worktree (and no
    -All) prints a one-line reason followed by this help, changes nothing, and
    exits with code 2.

    GIT
    Links and copies must not be committed. Make sure each private name is
    ignored in every branch's .gitignore (for example /.env). A pattern with a
    trailing slash does not match a symlink. Afterwards 'git status --short'
    should not list them.

    HOW TO TELL A LINK
        ls -Force dev                  # shows  .env -> ..\.shared\.env
        Get-Item dev\.env -Force | Select-Object LinkType, Target

.PARAMETER Link
    Action: link each item into the worktree(s) with a relative symlink.

.PARAMETER Copy
    Action: put a real copy of each item into the worktree(s).

.PARAMETER Unlink
    Action: convert each link into the worktree(s) into a real copy.

.PARAMETER Worktree
    One or more worktree folders, separated by spaces (no parameter name
    needed). Each may be a name relative to the project root (dev), a path
    relative to the current directory (.\dev, or . when you are already inside
    the worktree), or a full path. The folder must exist and be inside the
    project root. Use this or -All, not both.

.PARAMETER All
    Act on every worktree reported by 'git worktree list' (the bare repository
    is skipped). Use this or worktree names, not both.

.PARAMETER Name
    Limit the run to these files from .shared\, for example -Name .env,db.sqlite3.
    Use paths relative to .shared\ for nested files, such as
    -Name config\config.ini (forward slashes work too). Default: every existing
    file inside .shared\ and its subfolders. A name is always a single file:
    a folder name (such as -Name secrets), or a file that does not exist, is an
    error. To limit the run to a folder, name each file in it.

.PARAMETER Force
    With -link or -copy: also replace a real file (after a backup, see above)
    and a link that points somewhere else. Never replaces a folder. Has no
    effect with -unlink.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Show what would happen ("would symlink ...") without changing anything.
    Recommended before -copy, -unlink, or anything with -Force or -All.

.EXAMPLE
    .\yngshared.ps1 -link dev

    Link every existing file inside .shared\ into dev\, preserving subfolders.

.EXAMPLE
    .\yngshared.ps1 -link -All -WhatIf

    Preview linking every worktree; nothing is changed.

.EXAMPLE
    .\yngshared.ps1 -copy agent-x -Name .env

    Give the agent-x worktree its own copy of .env only (opt out of sharing
    for that file).

.EXAMPLE
    .\yngshared.ps1 -copy dev -Name config\config.ini

    Give dev its own copy of the nested file config\config.ini; the rest of
    dev's links are untouched.

.EXAMPLE
    .\yngshared.ps1 -unlink dev

    Make dev's links into real, independent copies.

.EXAMPLE
    .\yngshared.ps1 -link main dev -Force

    Link two worktrees, replacing any real .env already there (backed up first).

    Works in Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.

    Output, one line per item ("would ..." instead when -WhatIf is used):
        symlink   created a relative symbolic link
        copy      created a real copy
        backup    renamed an existing real file (-Force)
        keep      left alone (see the note after it)
        skip      nothing to do
        warn      refused; counts as a problem
        error     something failed; counts as a problem

    Exit code: 0 = success, 1 = a warning or error occurred, 2 = usage mistake.

    Type switches out in full. PowerShell accepts short abbreviations, but one
    that fits more than one switch (such as -E or -W, which also match
    PowerShell's built-in switches) is rejected by PowerShell itself before
    this script can print the help.
